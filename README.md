# What is Troll? ‚ùì
Troll or as its different vareables that are the same, is an application used to use it as a joke on your friends, using multimedia content (Nothing +18), sounds, etc, apart from reviving in the years where more viruses were made, the iconic HTML **You're an idiot.**

# How does it work? üîß
Troll, it works as follows: 
* Warns the user that if they have **epilepsy** not to watch everything that happens as there is no button to stop or anything like that, unless it is through the: **Task Manager**.
* After the warning, the "madness" will start as it opens a **You're an idiot** window, moving the mouse randomly, and turning up the volume of the computer!
* After 15 seconds, it opens a window that cannot be closed because it occupies the entire screen, with a MessageBox, I ask the user if **he is an idiot?**
* When answering the 3 MessagesBoxes, it will start a sound of You're an idiot, after that it will start ByteBeat sounds (Sounds created by Mathematics) as well as the famous GDIs (Not all of them are bytebeat sounds, there is one of a Meme).
* All those ByteBeat and GDI sounds, will start a video of a meme that I won't tell you what it is, see for yourselves!
* When you finish all the GDI and ByteBeat sounds, it will leave a file of what it is really about (it is not a virus).

# Faq ü§î
Q: **Is this a virus?**

R: No this is not a malware or virus, although there are some antivirus that detect Virus, but the biggest antivirus like: **AVG, Avast, Win Defender, MalwareBytes, Kaspersky, ESET-NOD32, among others** do not detect it as malware or something dangerous, here you have the report made by me in [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9f7b386a7184191f63b293403291719a56163552efa6f91386a060b471e129ab?nocache=1), you can try in Tria.ge or Any.Run, although I am also making these antivirus not detect this as dangerous.

Q: **Is a component or something necessary?**

R: If you need components but they are few, you need: **.Net Framework 4.6 (Major or Equal)**, and you need two DLLs files, created by Microsoft that are necessary to play the videos in the execution, but don't worry, these files are already included in the ZIP that is on github.

Q: **I have an error or I passed an error to my friend, how can I report it?**

R: You can report it in the Github Issues, please if possible a screenshot of the error and the explanation of when it happened in detail.

Q: **This has multi-language support?**

R: Yes, it has support for Spanish and English, only those two, but soon we will add some more.

Q: **Where can I download it?**

R: You can download the beta version of this at [Setup-Dotnet](https://github.com/Joseantonio2354/Troll/raw/main/Setup.zip)

Q: **What is the ZIP password?**

R: The password is: **troll** (All versions have the same password)
